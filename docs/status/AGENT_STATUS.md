## Current objective
WAITING. As of READY_QUEUE @ `bf215b2`, no READY task is assigned to 06 or ANY. **F-04** (the UI's `SpineBackend` using the worker's real `Components`, i.e. 05's PDP) is BLOCKED on **A-03**. I will claim F-04 as soon as A-03 is DONE, or any new F-/ANY task Agent 01 queues.

## Done
- **F-01 follow-through @ `e2e42f8`:** the UI now calls the spine's `mbos.workflows.notify_decision` (A-07, which closes P-06-1). The spine is re-pinned to `bf215b2`, and a new test covers R12: a YES on a HELD item re-presents it, then executes once. 42 tests pass.
- **F-03 @ `cb787dd`:** comms dry-run spec as data in `comms_spec/`:
  - a template registry with ADR-0010 content hashes and binding flags; every template is a draft pending Michael;
  - Q&A for all 10 flip and all 9 service categories;
  - send-window, rate, consent, DNC and opt-out policy;
  - E1–E7 thresholds;
  - pure checks and a receipt auditor.

  There is no send path, and a test enforces that. Spec: `docs/research/agent-06-comms-spec.md`. Receipt: `docs/receipts/2026-10-07-f03-comms-spec-data.md`.
- **F-02 @ `fc31896`** (ADR-0010):
  - `operator_ui/mbos_canonical.py` is a byte-identical copy of the reference.
  - The card verifies `payload_hash` independently, and offers YES only on a match.
  - The ledger re-verifies the chain with MBOS-RH-1 in Python.
  - **Interop row 06 = 10/10 CONFORMS** (with row 06 repointed; see coordinator review).
  - The spine is re-pinned to `99e9ec0`. 15 tests pass. Receipt: `docs/receipts/2026-10-07-f02-adr0010-conformance.md`.
- **F-01 @ `190bb9b`** (ruling R10): the Operator UI runs on the spine.
  - Every YES/NO/MODIFY/HOLD is `mbos.spine.decide(channel="web")` in one transaction, plus a DBOS wake.
  - HOLD timers live in the item workflow. "Wake now" sends `michael_ping`.
  - The UI's own gateway, `tick()`, SQLite ledger, mock effector and seed data are removed. A test guards against them coming back.
  - Kept: cards, CSRF, loopback-only, Host check, PIN step-up, HOLD presets.
  - **11 tests pass against the real spine** (DBOS + pgserver Postgres 16; `mbos` pinned at `bed7609`, installed, not merged).
  - Receipt: `docs/receipts/2026-10-07-f01-operator-ui-on-spine.md`. Spec: `docs/research/agent-06-operator-ui.md`.
- Wave one (`3e51ba4`): first UI with a SQLite stand-in, 29 tests. Superseded by F-01.
- Round One: comms research, ADR-001/002, receipts 01–04.

## Findings (F-01)
- FACT: `notify_decision`, named in R10, does not exist in the spine at `bed7609`. The UI uses the same wake as `mbos decide` (`DBOSClient.send(item:<id>, …, topic="decision")`).
- FACT: the item workflow acts on `hold_until`, `escalate_after`, `renotify_after` and `michael_ping`, but **not** on `new_info`, `price_change` or `auction_ending` in `wake_on`.
- FACT: the spine always archives after NO, so the UI's "archive?" checkbox was removed.
- INFERENCE: `SpineBackend.components` must equal the worker's `Components`, because `spine.decide` classifies MODIFY successors with the PDP. This matters once A-03 wires 05's PDP.

## Blockers
None.

## Needs Michael decision
None. Live comms stay disabled (MICHAEL_DECISIONS #4).

## Needs coordinator review
- Resolved in `bf215b2`: interop row 06 now points at the vendored reference. P-06-1 became A-07 (DONE), P-06-2 became A-08 (READY, lane A), and P-06-3 became F-04 (BLOCKED on A-03).
- The comms policy values in `comms_spec/data/comms_policy.v1.json` are PROPOSED (conservative). Loosening any of them is a version bump.

## Proposed tasks
- **P-06-4 (lanes F + A):** wire `comms_spec` into the planner (R9 `ActionPlanner`): `questions()` + `render()` draft the payload, `action_constraints()` sets tier/category, and the payload carries `template_id`/`template_hash`. This needs 01's planner interface, so it must be queued, not self-started.
- **P-06-5 (lane F, after live gate):** a comms effector that writes `consent_check` / `dnc_check` / `send_window_check` / `disclosure_present` into `details.kind=comms`, so `comms_spec.audit()` can grade E1–E7. Blocked on MICHAEL_DECISIONS #4 for anything live; a dry-run version could come earlier.
